- implement `#most_successful` that returns the number of movies published prior to a given year, with associated earnings.
- **constraint**: the returned list should be an array of movies. Each movie should be represented by a hash with keys `name`, `year` and `earnings`. Ex: `{ name: "Avatar", year: 2009, earnings: 760505847 }`
